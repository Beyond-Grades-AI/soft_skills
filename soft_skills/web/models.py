# No, you don't need to have a questions attribute field in the Test model because Django automatically generates a reverse relation for ForeignKey fields.
# In your Question model, you have defined a ForeignKey field named test that establishes a relationship between Question and Test. This ForeignKey field creates a relationship where each Question instance is associated with a single Test instance.
# When you define a ForeignKey in Django, it automatically creates a reverse relation on the related model (in this case, Test). This reverse relation allows you to access related objects from the other side of the relationship. In your case, since you've specified related_name='questions' in the ForeignKey definition, you can access the related Question objects from a Test instance using the questions attribute.
# For example, if you have a Test instance named my_test, you can access its related Question objects like this:
# my_questions = my_test.questions.all()
